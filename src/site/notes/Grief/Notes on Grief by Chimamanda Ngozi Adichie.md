##### QUOTES THAT RESONATE 

“I came undone.”


“Is this what shock means, that the air turns to glue?”


“Grief is a cruel kind of education. You learn how ungentle mourning can be, how full of anger. You learn how glib condolences can feel. You learn how much grief is about language, the failure of language and the grasping for language.”


“The pain is not surprising, but its physicality is: my tongue unbearably bitter, as though I ate a loathed meal and forgot to clean my teeth; on my chest, a heavy, awful weight; and inside my body, a sensation of eternal dissolving.”


“The laughter becomes tears and becomes sadness and becomes rage. I am unprepared for my wretched, roaring rage. In the face of this inferno that is sorrow, I am callow and unformed.”


“My fingers start to tremble and I push my phone away. He was not; he is.”


“My anger scares me, my fear scares me, and somewhere in there is shame, too—why am I so enraged and so scared?”


““How is it that the world keeps going, breathing in and out unchanged, while in my soul there is a permanent scattering?”


“I wish, I wish. The guilt gnaws at my soul.”


“How quickly my life has become another life, how pitiless this becoming is, and yet how slow I am to adapt.”



“…my memories bring eloquent stabs of pain that say, “This is what you will never again have.” Sometimes they bring laughter, but laughter like glowing coals that soon burst aflame in pain.”


“I am not ready. I talk only to my closest family. It is instinctive, my recoiling. I imagine the confusion of some relatives, their disapproval even, when faced with my withdrawal, the calls I leave unanswered, the messages unread.”


“…it is a protective stance, a shrinking from further pain, because I am drained limp from crying, and to speak about it would be to cry again.”


“…he was so respectful of our boundaries, and so grateful for the smallest things, was like a priceless trimming.”


“Never” has come to stay. “Never” feels so unfairly punitive. For the rest of my life, I will live with my hands outstretched for things that are no longer there.


“Grief was the celebration of love, those who could feel real grief were lucky to have loved.”


“Does love bring, even if unconsciously, the delusional arrogance of expecting never to be touched by grief?”


“The family shape is changed forever.”


“Imagine dreading a burial and yet longing for it to pass.”

“Writing “funeral” is impossible for me.”


“I am heartsick to see her look so brave and so drained.”


“A dark time inexorably darkened.”

“The layers of loss make life feel papery thin.”


“It does not matter whether I want to be changed, because I am changed. A new voice is pushing itself out of my writing, full of the closeness I feel to death, the awareness of my own mortality, so finely threaded, so acute.”
