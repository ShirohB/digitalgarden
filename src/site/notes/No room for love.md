### ABANDONING LOVE

Love is not for me
It’s uncomfortable 
It’s beyond my reach
Love is a strange thing 
Why do we show it 
how we want to be loved
Yet ignoring how they need to feel loved
Why doesn’t it come naturally 
Why do you admire other loves
Not building your own forte
Why build love and lose
Yet nothing can fill the void 
Why try when it’ll only leave hurt
A trail that burns as it runs
The gold medal in a marathon 
Suffocating it’s path
Nowhere to hide and seek solace 
There’s no room in here
Love less and hurt less
I’m not handing out tickets anymore 
Infact there’s no concert 
No show 
Please leave 
Don’t come through that door 
Let me build cobwebs 
Pile mounds of dust
Don’t clean me up
I like the solitude of silence 
No emotional drama 
No expectations 
I want to be that island 
They say no man can be 
Build the walls 
High up to the falls
No crevice no windows 
Just Jehovah’s light 
Shining down the abyss 
Of a cold dark soul 
Abandoning love
