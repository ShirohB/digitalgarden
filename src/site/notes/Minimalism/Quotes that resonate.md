“saying goodbye to your things is more than an exercise in tidying up. I think it’s an exercise in thinking about true happiness.”


“Happiness is not having what you want, but wanting what you have.
—RABBI HYMAN SCHACHTEL”


“About sixty thousand different thoughts are said to go through a person’s mind over the course of a day. Ninety-five percent of that is made up of the same things we’d been thinking about the day before, and 80 percent of those thoughts are believed to be negative.”

““No matter how much we wish for something, over time it becomes a normal part of our lives, and then a tired old item that bores us, even though we did actually get our wish. And we end up being unhappy.
In other words, we can continue being happy if we can maintain that sense of joy that we experienced when we initially fulfilled our wish. If we could just be satisfied with what we have, then we wouldn’t have to keep buying more and better things.”


“no matter how rich you become, no matter how many things you own, the joy from all your things won’t be much different from how you feel now. There are emotional limitations to the feelings of happiness that we’re able to experience when we obtain something for the first time.”

“You get stuck in this eternal loop and the number of possessions you have continues to increase. In the back of your mind you know that you’ll never be satisfied, but you keep thinking that maybe this time the brief sense of happiness you feel will be the real thing. These are the mechanics of unhappiness, and they exist no matter how much you spend, no matter how much you own.”

“We are social animals that act in packs; we can’t thrive without proving our existence has value. We need others to recognize our qualities so we can believe that our life is worth living.”

“minimizing the effort it takes to minimize is often the key to success.”

“For a minimalist, the objective isn’t to reduce, it’s to eliminate distractions so they can focus on the things that are truly important...Once you’ve gone ahead and minimized, it’s time to find out what those important things are.”

“Aristotle believed (as paraphrased by philosopher Will Durant) that “We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit.” ”
