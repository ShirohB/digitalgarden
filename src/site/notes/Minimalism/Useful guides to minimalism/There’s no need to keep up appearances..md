Don’t keep something just because it portrays you in a certain light which isn’t your authentic self. Strive to be an individual and let go of what’s not you. This includes letting go of your past self (hobbies you don’t practice anymore etc). We morph, we change, accept that. 


**QUOTES:**

“In her best-selling book on the magic of tidying up, Marie Kondo came up with the killer phrase about sparking joy. The simple method of touching objects and leaving only the things that spark joy can be very useful.”
