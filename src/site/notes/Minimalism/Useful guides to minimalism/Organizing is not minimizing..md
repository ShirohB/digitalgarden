Focus on reducing the number of items, not arranging them to look pretty. Get rid of storage containers- when our stuff isn’t neatly tucked away, it becomes an eyesore and hence easier to part with. 

**QUOTES:**

“A storage area packed with our possessions is like a crowded commuter train. It isn’t a soothing sight. And it takes more time and effort than we think to maintain its initial state. It’s actually open space, left empty, that gives us peace of mind.”
