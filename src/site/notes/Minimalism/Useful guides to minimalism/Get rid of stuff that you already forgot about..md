If you haven’t missed it all this time, you don’t need it. So don’t get creative with excuses to keep it! 


**QUOTES:**

“Chances are, what you’ve just envisioned will never come to be. Most of these thoughts are desperate ideas that pop into our minds because we really don’t want to part with our old possessions. We are never more creative than when we’re trying to throw things out. No matter how fantastic these ideas might be, it’s probably wiser to do your best to ignore them.”
