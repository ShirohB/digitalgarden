Discard anything you haven’t used in a year. (Unless it’s go bag stuff. Even that needs regular checking, especially the food) Make it a consistent habit.

**QUOTES:**

“Dust isn’t very pleasant but it is a useful sign that tells us maybe it’s time to consider throwing an item away. The heavier the layer of dust, the less we’ve used something. ”
