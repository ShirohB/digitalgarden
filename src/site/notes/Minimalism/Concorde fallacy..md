“The development of the Concorde, a supersonic jet, is said to have cost about £4 billion. The British and French governments continued to pour money into the project even when it was clear the jet wasn’t going to be commercially successful, and it eventually led to about £10 billion in losses. Even when we know that the outlook isn’t very bright, it’s hard to stop doing something when you consider the time, effort, and costs that have already gone into development.”
