SUMMARY
Minimalism is a journey beyond the simplification of life and reduction of possessions. It involves the pursuit of happiness and authenticity. Research shows that the happier people are, the longer they live. Just like it is in that Italian island village - Sardinia. Or even Okinawa, Japan. Minimalism is a mindset that grounds you…it’s contentment. It’s not linear- everyone can find their own kind of minimalism. It’s also not a competition- don’t boast, don’t judge.

TIPS I FOUND HELPFUL FOR EMBRACING MINIMALISM
1. Focus on the positive, not the loss. It’s hard especially when we’re attached to something. But think of how minimizing will be of benefit to you.
2. Find out why it’s hard to part with something. “Is it because it was expensive? Is it because you feel guilty about throwing it away? Are you ashamed that you were never able to make good use of it? Do you feel bad for the person who gave it to you? Does it feel like you’re throwing away a fond memory that is attached to it? Is your vanity preventing you from parting with something? Or is it just easier to leave it where it is?”
3. Get rid of something extra right now. Start with stuff that’s obviously junk- from the kitchen, bathroom, wardrobe, anywhere! Then reduce the stuff that’s in multiples all the way down to one of each. “If you wait until you have the time, you’ll never have the time. This is the first step, right now, toward a minimalist life.”
4. Closet clean every year. Discard anything you haven’t used in a year. (Unless it’s go bag stuff. Even that needs regular checking, especially the food) “Dust isn’t very pleasant but it is a useful sign that tells us maybe it’s time to consider throwing an item away. The heavier the layer of dust, the less we’ve used something. ”
5. No need to keep up appearances. Don’t keep something just because it portrays you in a certain light which isn’t your authentic self. Strive to be an individual and let go of what’s not you. This includes letting go of your past self (hobbies you don’t practice anymore etc). We morph, we change, accept that. “In her best-selling book on the magic of tidying up, Marie Kondo came up with the killer phrase about sparking joy. The simple method of touching objects and leaving only the things that spark joy can be very useful.”
6. Differentiate between wants and needs. If you were to lose the item, would you be willing to pay full price for it? Before a purchase, ask yourself why and pay attention to the answers. “The Buddhist monk Ryunosuke Koike says he puts his hand against his chest when he’s not sure about an item, and it will feel uncomfortable if the item is merely something that he wants. This discomfort is a symptom of dissatisfaction, of the mistaken belief that there’s something missing from his life even though he already has everything he needs.” “Ask yourself which of your items would truly be necessary if you were to start with zero belongings. What if everything you owned was stolen? What if you had to move next week? Which items would you take with you?”
7. Go digital. Minimalism doesn’t mean losing your precious memories. Save them as digital files on the cloud which you can access anywhere anytime!
8. Organizing is not minimizing. Focus on reducing the number of items, not arranging them to look pretty. Get rid of storage containers- when our stuff isn’t neatly tucked away, it becomes an eyesore and hence easier to part with. “A storage area packed with our possessions is like a crowded commuter train. It isn’t a soothing sight. And it takes more time and effort than we think to maintain its initial state. It’s actually open space, left empty, that gives us peace of mind.”
9. Don’t feel like you need to fill every empty space.
10. Don’t keep it coz you think you’ll need it someday. If you don’t need it today, you probably won’t in future.
11. Get rid of stuff that you already forgot about. If you haven’t missed it all this time, you don’t need it. So don’t get creative with excuses to keep it! “Chances are, what you’ve just envisioned will never come to be. Most of these thoughts are desperate ideas that pop into our minds because we really don’t want to part with our old possessions. We are never more creative than when we’re trying to throw things out. No matter how fantastic these ideas might be, it’s probably wiser to do your best to ignore them.”
12. You’ll probably not get your money’s worth. If an item was expensive, you may never recover the cost. Keeping it will only take up space mentally and physically. “Whether or not you have any interest in the stock market, you would probably agree that it’s wiser to get rid of stocks if they continue to fall with no prospects of a rebound. The same can be said for the bulk of our possessions. We should let go of the concept of getting our money’s worth, and cut our losses sooner rather than later. ”
13. Have a balanced view of sentimental attachment. Discarding gifts is hard. It leaves you feeling guilty so you hang on to stuff you have absolutely no use for. It’s no sin to discard such, since the gratitude stays in our memory.
14. Things tend to bring in more things. Ex. After buying a bike, you wanna get riding gear, a helmet,  a bottle holder, tools, spares etc…“We sometimes don’t know when to stop, and we end up wasting too much money and time. Watch out for things that can lead to the

“The development of the Concorde, a supersonic jet, is said to have cost about £4 billion. The British and French governments continued to pour money into the project even when it was clear the jet wasn’t going to be commercially successful, and it eventually led to about £10 billion in losses. Even when we know that the outlook isn’t very bright, it’s hard to stop doing something when you consider the time, effort, and costs that have already gone into development.”

”“Conversely, we’ll be able to get rid of a lot of items at once if we dispose of the initial source.”
15. The golden rule- one in one out. It has to be items of the same kind.

“saying goodbye to your things is more than an exercise in tidying up. I think it’s an exercise in thinking about true happiness.”


“Happiness is not having what you want, but wanting what you have.
—RABBI HYMAN SCHACHTEL”


“About sixty thousand different thoughts are said to go through a person’s mind over the course of a day. Ninety-five percent of that is made up of the same things we’d been thinking about the day before, and 80 percent of those thoughts are believed to be negative.”

““No matter how much we wish for something, over time it becomes a normal part of our lives, and then a tired old item that bores us, even though we did actually get our wish. And we end up being unhappy.
In other words, we can continue being happy if we can maintain that sense of joy that we experienced when we initially fulfilled our wish. If we could just be satisfied with what we have, then we wouldn’t have to keep buying more and better things.”


“no matter how rich you become, no matter how many things you own, the joy from all your things won’t be much different from how you feel now. There are emotional limitations to the feelings of happiness that we’re able to experience when we obtain something for the first time.”

“You get stuck in this eternal loop and the number of possessions you have continues to increase. In the back of your mind you know that you’ll never be satisfied, but you keep thinking that maybe this time the brief sense of happiness you feel will be the real thing. These are the mechanics of unhappiness, and they exist no matter how much you spend, no matter how much you own.”

“We are social animals that act in packs; we can’t thrive without proving our existence has value. We need others to recognize our qualities so we can believe that our life is worth living.”

“minimizing the effort it takes to minimize is often the key to success.”

“For a minimalist, the objective isn’t to reduce, it’s to eliminate distractions so they can focus on the things that are truly important...Once you’ve gone ahead and minimized, it’s time to find out what those important things are.”

“Aristotle believed (as paraphrased by philosopher Will Durant) that “We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit.” ”
