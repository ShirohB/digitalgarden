### Beauty…

How to define it?
I think it’s simply a mystery 
Since it can take any a trajectory 
The smell of freshly brewed coffee 
The shades of fun at a party
The warmth of shelter under a blanket 
Or the glee mid air, how do you rank it?
Slithering flawlessly underwater 
Jehovah’s standards we don’t falter 
His lingering scent in your nostrils 
And her endless stream of insta reels 
Feeling his hug long after he’s gone 
The smile after you share a yawn
The longing as you take your vows
New concepts your interest rouse
Muscles toned after consistently training 
A good book next to a fire whilst it’s raining
Waking up to tons of messages from you 
Videos photos detailed descriptions in tow
Is it the intoxication of live music
Or forest bathing that’s therapeutic
Warm cuddles any time of day
A connection forged in how we say
Random acts and words of kindness 
A good meal with wine as the mistress 
Sunlit hedge green and concrete grey
Illuminated raindrops on a rainy day
Cute clean cuddly babies 
Good energy, supportive ladies 
It’s an endless cascade 
Take a pick from your arcade 
What’s your beauty?
