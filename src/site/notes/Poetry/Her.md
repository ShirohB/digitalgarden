### HER

She’s been hurt but not broken 
Frustrated but she’s still devoted 
Friendships have been devastated 
But her unending love still undiluted 
Such a heart of gold who can find?
Despite her trials she seeks to bind
See the good in others wherever she goes
Her sweet inviting smile comes in tow
I’ve come to believe she’s a beautiful soul 
She inspires parts of me I didn’t even know 
I’ve barely scratched the surface 
I understand she isn’t perfect 
Yet deep down in my being 
Such a soul I’ve been needing 
Her friendship I’ll be seeking 
Hoping it’ll be a mutual feeling
