### I wanna be your phone 

Then you’ll search for me first thing in the morning 
You’ll wanna know how my night was 
The places i journeyed to
You’ll look for me when you’re feeling bored
You’ll want to explore my every nook and cranny 
Find out how my mind works
You’ll wanna take me everywhere you go
I’ll be your priority
Never a nuisance 
You’ll silence everyone to listen to me
Even when it’s nothing important 
I’ll be a constant in your life
You wouldn’t know what you’d do without me
You’ll look for me throughout the day 
See how I’m doing and if there’s anything new
You’ll take care of me
Ensure I have no cracks
That I’m not in pain 
Emotionally...
Physically...
Mentally...
How blissful it would feel
I wanna be your phone!
