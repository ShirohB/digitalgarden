### THAT FRIEND 

You know that human 
The one you can talk about your fears with
Explain in details with names and faces
Not holding back a morsel 
That friend who gets you
Without you trying too much 
Same wavelength same frequency 
The one who doesn’t have to experience 
To understand your emotions 
The one you don’t fear judgement 
Who is just present and aware
Listening to verbal cues 
But pursues what the eyes observe
That friend who asks questions 
Not just to have 411
But with a view to understanding 
The one who makes you feel heard
Who points you to the positive 
Leaving your heart calm
And mind at peace 
That friend I treasure 
That friend I love ❤️ 
I pray the friendship is a constant 
Coz to find and lose this 
Would be the biggest tragedy
