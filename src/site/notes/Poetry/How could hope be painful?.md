How could hope be painful?
Please help me understand 
Thought this change would be useful 
But it’s just making me mad
Tiny brain is cramped full
Neurons and synapses scarred 
By images of thoughts that rule
Taking reign rendering me trapped 
You’re such an awesome dude
I remember how we laughed 
That deep belly fruit 
Can’t believe you crashed 
Now she can’t stay mute 
The door is cracked 
Claiming some loot
I can’t trail back 
Forward on route 
Gotta give hope a chance!
