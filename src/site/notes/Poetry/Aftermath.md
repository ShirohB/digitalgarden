### THE AFTERMATH

Thé situation isn’t what drains you 
Deep down you know it’s true 
His cold body dark and blue 
Only a reminder of what is new
This decomposition is grief that’s due
The aftermath of which you don’t pursue 
The pain incurred is paid in lieu 
Of the joy we’d have if he didn’t change hue
