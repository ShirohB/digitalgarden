### EMBERS

Conscious thoughts 
Gravitate toward you 
The last hug we shared
Your cheeky smile 
Conversations intriguing 
Your selfless manner 
And quick temper
Your kindness 
And aggression 
Your generosity 
And demands
You’re an impervious irony
How I love you so 
I wish I could show you 
But you’re too far away 
Hope there’ll be another chance 
To share my love with you 
I shall not lose what I have 
Over what I’ve lost
My goal this memorial-
To rekindle the ember of hope
Withered stalks turn green
Epidermis desquamation 
And regeneration 
So dead bones can come alive 
Until we meet again 
So long baby K
