### IDEA 
According to a theory from the sports psychologist Gabriele Wulf, we do worse at an activity when we focus on ourselves, instead of some “external” target.”

A focus on the self can prompt “micro-choking,” getting in the way of automatic movement—which is what we’re aiming for  with skilled behavior.


##### BEGINNERS TAKE
“Darts players do better if they focus on the board and not their own arms; golfers do better if they focus on the hole and not their elbows. Even musicians, it’s been shown, seem to do better if they focus on overall sound rather than on their fingers strumming the instrument.”
