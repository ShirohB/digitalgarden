### IDEA
A beginner’s mind is curiously similar to the mind at the initial stages of a love affair.

##### BEGINNERS TAKE
In the beginnings of a love affair, we are in what has been called an “extreme neurobiological state”: The brain is jacked on a supersized hyper-caffeinated energy drink of dopamine and stress hormones (the good kind). Our language often reverts to a fragile, childlike babble, as if we were born anew. It will all eventually calm down.

Learning a new skill is somewhat similar. Your brain is in a state of hyperawareness, bathing in novelty, and almost overwhelmed 



##### QUOTES
“As you plunge into learning some art or skill, the world around you appears new and bursting with infinite horizons. Each day brims with new discoveries as you take your tentative first steps, slowly pushing the bounds of exploration.”

“You’re freed from the worries of “impostor syndrome”—that anxiety of not being the expert you’re cracked up to be—because no one actually expects you to be any good”

“In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities,” writes Shunryu Suzuki. “In the expert’s mind there are few.”
