### self-control

It’s your ability to resolve conflicts between your short-term desires and your long-term goals. It means sacrificing immediate pleasure if it’s not in harmony with your goals and choosing instead a delayed reward which is congruent with your goals.

##### QUOTES

“You can choose between an option that yields a smaller immediate reward (pleasant taste of food, fun from watching TV or pleasure from socializing with friends) and an option that yields a larger but delayed reward (staying healthy, maintaining good weight, or reaching a higher income). The immediately gratifying option is called a ‘temptation’.”
