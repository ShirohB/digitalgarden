### TEMPTATION BUNDLING 

Temptation bundling means that you pair an indulgence with a goal-promoting activity. For it to work, the indulgence can’t be enjoyed at any other time.

“Researchers tracked participant’s attendance of the gym for ten weeks. One group was given iPods with highly addictive audio novels (such as The Hunger Games). There was a condition though – they were allowed to use their iPods only at the gym. The study showed that compared to the control group, students’ attendance to the gym increased by 20%.”
