### SUMMARY 

Variety seems to help promote faster learning 

##### QUOTE 

“When we practice a variety of skills, rather than long, monotonous drills in the same skill, we often do worse during the practice session but better in the long run. Because we have to work harder to remember the different exercises, and the ways we solved them, we perform them better.”
