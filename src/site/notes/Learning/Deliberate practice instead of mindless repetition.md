### IDEA:
There’s a difference between deliberate practice and  mindless repetition. Deliberate practice is the ultimate if we’re to learn and progress.

##### BEGINNERS TAKE
Both Tom and his daughter were beginners in the world of chess. The difference however, was Tom majorly played a few minutes of online blitz, while his daughter had a tutor. 

##### QUOTES
“Where I was just playing online game after online game, hoping to get better through sheer exposure—attributing wins to my talent and losses to bad luck—she was being drilled in opening theory and endgame tactics by Simon. When she lost a game, she would have to analyze, in painstaking detail, why she lost. Importantly, this often took longer than the actual match.”

“any learning process, requires thoughtful practice”

“As Ravi Kumar, president of the IT giant Infosys, describes it, “You have to learn to learn, learn to unlearn, and learn to re-learn.”
