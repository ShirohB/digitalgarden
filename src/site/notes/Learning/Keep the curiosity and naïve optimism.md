### IDEA
Ask questions… be like a child…be willing to look foolish and ask the obvious questions. Retain the hyper vigilant alertness of novelty.


##### BEGINNERS TAKE 
“Take the curious case, reported in The New York Times, of a funeral home that had accidentally placed the wrong body in a casket.

At the funeral, the grieving adults had noted how the deceased, a beloved relative who had died of cancer, looked strangely different from the woman they remembered. But they all found ways to explain the difference. The chemo had changed her hair. Time on a respirator had changed the way she looked. The adults, used to living in an ordered, rational world, did not consider the possibility of such a colossal mistake. They used all their knowledge and wisdom to deceive themselves. It took a ten-year-old boy among them to raise the preposterous suggestion, only later confirmed to be the startling truth: The body before them was not their relative.”
