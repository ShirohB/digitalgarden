### SUMMARY 
I feel like this was majorly a book to show the importance of being a novice… putting all biases aside and learning. Not just learning, but also learning how to learn. It goes through the process of learning different skills…clearly defining their similarities and differences. As Tom Vanderbilt put it, “an early lesson in learning: It is context dependent”
