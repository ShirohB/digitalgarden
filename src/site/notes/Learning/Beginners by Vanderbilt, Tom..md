### SUMMARY 
I feel like this was majorly a book to show the importance of being a novice… putting all biases aside and learning. Not just learning, but also learning how to learn. It goes through the process of learning different skills…clearly defining their similarities and differences. As Tom Vanderbilt put it, “an early lesson in learning: It is context dependent”

### MAJOR TAKE HOME:

1.We all have latent abilities that can be unlocked

2.Skills take time

3.Failure is an essential part of learning- “Behind every highlight reel is a huge B-roll of mistakes.”

4.[[Learning/Change up your practice\|Change up your practice]]

5.Your [[Learning/progress may not be linear\|progress may not be linear]]

6.Skills rarely “transfer”

7.Always be on the [[Learning/edge of the impossible\|edge of the impossible]]

8.Learning skills helps open new worlds.

9.Goals are good, but keep your eyes open for opportunity- “As you try to learn something, you shouldn’t lose sight of all the interesting little detours along the way.”
