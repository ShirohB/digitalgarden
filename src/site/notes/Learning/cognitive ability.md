### IDEA

“People who study aging and the brain like to talk about two forms of cognitive ability: “fluid” and “crystallized” intelligence. Fluid intelligence helps you think on your feet and solve new problems. Crystallized intelligence is what a person already knows—wisdom, memories, metacognition. Fluid intelligence is generally seen to favor the young, while the crystallized variety is rewarded by age (though there are many exceptions).”
