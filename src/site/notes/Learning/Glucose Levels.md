### GLUCOSE
Glucose is fuel for the brain so all cognitive functions are limited by the supply of glucose to the brain.
To enhance your capacity for self-control, it’s far better to maintain a stable level of glucose in the blood by eating food with a low glycemic index.


##### QUOTES

“it’s theoretically possible (though not proven yet) that people fail in demanding self-control situations because their brains need more glucose than the blood can supply at a given point of time.”
