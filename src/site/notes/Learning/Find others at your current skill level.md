### IDEA
Experts are used to doing things a certain way and can hardly explain the why’s and how’s. Observing those on the same level can benefit us more especially since they know how it feels to be a beginner.

##### BEGINNERS TAKE

“Research suggests we can actually learn more by watching others who are closer to our skill levels perform the same task—mistakes and all—than by watching the flawless perfection of experts, who often can’t really explain how they do what they do, or much remember what it was like to be where you are.”
