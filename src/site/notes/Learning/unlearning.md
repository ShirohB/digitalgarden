### SUMMARY 
Unlearning is hard coz old behaviors tend to linger, never really going away. The trick isn’t to try and do what’s right, but to stop doing!

##### QUOTES

“When you are asked not to do something, instead of making the decision not to do it, you try to prevent yourself from doing it,” an Australian actor named F. M. Alexander wrote. “But this only means that you decide to do it, and then use muscle tension to prevent yourself from doing it.”
