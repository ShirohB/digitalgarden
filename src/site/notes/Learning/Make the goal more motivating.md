### GOAL VS TEMPTATION 
Involves making the temptation less tempting and the goal more motivating. This reduces the need for self-control. 
On motivation- If you only have have-to motivations, then you’ll experience self-control conflict. But if you have strong want-to motivations for your goals, you will automatically experience fewer obstacles and temptations.

##### QUOTES
“self-control is a value-based decision-making process...the brain first computes the subjective value of each option and then select the option with the highest positive value.”

“If the value difference is large, there’s no need for self-control conflict. The decision is made automatically. For example, if health is your core personal value and you love jogging, then going for a run will come naturally and won’t require much effort.”
