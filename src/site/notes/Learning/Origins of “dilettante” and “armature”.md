##### DILETTANTE:
That word, which has an almost entirely pejorative meaning today as a hopelessly superficial dabbler, is derived from the Italian dilettare, which means “to delight.” As the art historian Bruce Redford notes, “dilettante”—one who exhibits delight—entered English with the formation of the Society of Dilettanti, an eighteenth-century group of Englishmen who had returned from the grand tour brimming with enthusiasm for Continental art and culture. As the process of acquiring knowledge gradually became more specialized, Redford notes, the meaning of the word shifted. By the time George Eliot wrote Middlemarch in the early 1870s, the word had become an insult.

##### ARMATEUR:

What did this loaded word originally signify? 

****“To love,” 

…derived from the French aimer. 

With the increasing specialization of knowledge, and professionalization of everyday life, suddenly being delighted by something, or loving something, was seen as vaguely disreputable.
