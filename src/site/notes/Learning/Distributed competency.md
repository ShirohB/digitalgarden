### IDEA
proficiency is typically a level where one is able to perform a task or understand something, but perhaps with some struggle or room for improvement. To become competent is a step above that, and to achieve mastery is to reach a level of perfection. 

##### BEGINNERS TAKE
One needs to decide in advance the goal in learning. This determines the approach and investment in a particular endeavor.
Tom was hoping to learn a variety of skills not expecting to be a master of any.

### QUOTES:

“I wanted to make myself more marketable to me”


“I didn’t think I was going to master any of these things. I didn’t have a spare ten thousand hours—the suggested baseline of deliberate practice required to achieve mastery in a field—for anything; I’d be lucky to have a hundred hours for any one skill. In place of mastery, I was hoping for distributed competence.”

“Just because you’re not immediately good at something does not mean you won’t eventually get it.”
