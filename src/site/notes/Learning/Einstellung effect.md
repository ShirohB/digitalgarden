### IDEA
It’s the tendency for people to default to the familiar, even in the face of a more optimal novel solution. Instead, cultivate a fluid concept of function open to wider possibilities.


##### BEGINNERS TAKE
“In the famous “candle problem,” people are asked to attach a candle to the wall using nothing more than a box of matches and a box of tacks. People struggle to solve it because they get hung up on the “functional fixedness” of the box as a container for tacks, not as a theoretical shelf for the candle. ”


“consider an experiment involving a group of London taxi drivers, an oft-studied class with super-proficient navigational skills. They were asked to plan a route in a fictitious town whose layout they’d just learned. They did this quite well—much better than people who didn’t drive taxis. But when they were asked to plan a route in a new, fictitious area that was grafted onto the London they knew, their performance suffered. The London they knew—the “overlearned” London—was getting in the way.”
