### IDEA
The problem with beginners is that they’re always thinking about themselves doing the skill. When we become skilled at something, it becomes automatic. We don’t have to think much about it, because our brain, running on virtual autopilot, is constantly making predictions—and most of its predictions are true.

##### BEGINNERS TAKE 
“Knowledge helps,” wrote Jerome Bruner, “only when it descends into habits.”

“Just as our muscles get more efficient as we learn a skill, so does our brain”

“You’re amazed that you can still do something from so long ago; skills are like memories contained by the body.”
