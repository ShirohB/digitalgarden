### SUMMARY
A very short, information packed read. It exposes the ineffective ways of cultivating self-control and advocates for some effective strategies (which in my opinion are worth a try). The examples and studies quoted mostly have to do with exercise and diet - which might easily be the no.1 self-control issue most have to deal with.

First, let’s define [[Learning/Self-control\|Self-control]] and [[Learning/self-control conflicts\|self-control conflicts]]

### Limits to self-control:
1. [[Learning/Glucose Levels\|Glucose Levels]]
2. [[Learning/Habits\|Habits]]

### Self control strategies that don’t work:
1. [[Learning/Thought Suppression\|Thought Suppression]]
2. [[Learning/Resisting temptation\|Resisting temptation]]
