### CONNECTEDNESSES 
What you find tempting today, you’ll also likely find tempting tomorrow (and next month, next week and next year). Therefore, if you indulge today, you’re probably going to indulge tomorrow.
If you’re low on connectedness, it will be more difficult to identify self-control conflicts. If you’re high on connectedness, however, they’ll be much easier to deal with.

##### QUOTES

You assume that tomorrow, next week or next year you’ll be a different person. You’ll be more determined and better prepared to resist temptations than you are now. You don’t perceive your personal identity to be stable over time – you don’t have a strong connection to your future self. As a result, you don’t care too much about your future self – you give preference to the wants and needs of your current self.
