### DESPAIR

“What a terrible feeling to love someone and not be able to help them.”

“I’m having one of those moments that you have after losing someone—when you feel as if you’ve been kicked in the stomach and all your breath is gone, and you might never get it back”



Excerpt From
All the Bright Places
Jennifer Niven
