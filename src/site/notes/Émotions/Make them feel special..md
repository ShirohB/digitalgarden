### SHOW LOVE FEARLESSLY 

If today was your last, or their last, would you regret not saying “I love you!”? Not holding their hand? Not hugging them tight? Not reassuring them just how much they mean to you?
Would you carry around guilt?

### QUOTES
“I try to remember the last words I said to him, but I can’t. Only that they were angry and normal and unremarkable. What would I have said to him if I’d known I would never see him again?”

Excerpt From
All the Bright Places
Jennifer Niven
