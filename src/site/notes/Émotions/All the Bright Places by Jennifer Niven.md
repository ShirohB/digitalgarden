### ALL THE BRIGHT PLACES 
##### BY Jennifer Niven

### SUMMARY
This is a young adult read. The story of a boy- (TF) Theodore Finch and girl- Ultraviolet Remarkey-able (not her real name). A [bird](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finch)and a [flower](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viola_odorata). They meet atop a bell tower in their high school where both are contemplating end of life. Their journey spans US Geography, different family demographics, School friends, bullying, mental health, trauma, loss, love, lust, pleasure, mutual healing, adventure, life and eventually - suicide. It takes the reader through a cascade of emotions from a very realistic point of view (in my opinion)

### MY TAKE
I initially thought it would be triggering. Centered around mental health, suicide and death. Still I ventured. But it’s written in such an easy, light fashion. I got through 65% in one sitting. The remaining 35% was actually heavy, dark and 100% triggering. I ugly cried and snorted through it all. I got lost in the whirlwind. But I also found camaraderie amidst the chaos. 
My running thought is that people rarely ever speak what’s actually on their mind. Many factors determine what we say and to whom we say it. Also, [[Émotions/you never really know someone.\|you never really know someone.]] You know the parts of them they are willing to reveal to you.
