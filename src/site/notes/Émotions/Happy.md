### HAPPY

A person? A place? A feeling?
We once were 
In the company of each other 
Before darkness visited us 
Separating one from the other 
Causing squabbles
Taking sides
Distance 
Isolation 
Then real gloom
The abyss has never been that deep 
The skies never that grey
The wind never that biting 
The grass never that brown 
Shades of pencil art
No color 
No taste 
No sound 
It’s never been this cold
Life ought to move on 
Everyone else has 
Just
There’s this deep hole in my being 
I can’t ignore 
Even when a leaf falls
I squirm in pain 
The ending of life
Embracing non existence 
Can’t wrap my heart around that
Leaf, stay green 
Live on forever 
Don’t loosen your grip 
That twig can carry your weight
Let it bend
It won’t break 
Come close to ground 
But stay green! 
Happy- not just life
The enjoyment of it
Can we get that back?
