### TALK ABOUT PAIN 

It can be hard, draining or uncomfortable. But it’s important to make space for hurtful feelings. Feel them, share them and let them go. Getting awkward blocks the path to healing.

TJ and Ultraviolet would write words on sticky notes. The positive ones go on the wall. The negative ones would be torn up and thrown in a pile on the floor. Feeling and letting go.

### QUOTES:
“In those moments, none of it matters. It’s like that stuff is happening to someone else because all you feel is dark inside, and that darkness just kind of takes over”

“So it’s good and it’s bad and it hurts, but I like thinking about him. If I think about him, he won’t be completely gone either. Just because they’re dead, they don’t have to be. And neither do we.”
