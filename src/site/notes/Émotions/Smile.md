### SMILE

When you’re not at your best, when you’re getting agitated, when you’re feeling off.

Smile…At strangers, at friends, at family, at foes, at random passers by, at someone who’s just been wronged, just smile. It makes you joyful, and it could just make someone’s day… or save their life!

### QUOTES

“Violet smiles back. Immediately, I feel better, because she feels better and because of the way she smiles at me, as if I’m not something to be avoided.”

“It’s because you smiled at me that day in class. A real smile, not the bullshit one I see you give everyone all the time where your eyes are doing one thing and your mouth is doing another.”
“It was just a smile.”
“Maybe to you.”

All the Bright Places
Jennifer Niven
