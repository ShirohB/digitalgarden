###### 1Sam 17:42 When the Phi·lisʹtine looked and saw David, he sneered at him in contempt because he was just a ruddy and handsome boy.

It’s not the first time someone viewed him in that light. His dad thought the same so he didn’t initially present him before prophet Samuel. His older brother Eliab felt like he was just being a boy who wants to watch a fight when he’d appeared at the battle line. Saul himself even told him that he can’t go fight coz he’s just a boy. Yet David had already successfully fought and killed a lion and a bear. David knew that he could depend upon the backing of Jehovah which removed the fear of all creatures from him. So he silenced all the negative voices around him telling him that he can’t and focused on the internal voice that added one detail - I can’t but Jehovah can. He turned what seemed to be a battle between humans into a battle between gods- the gods of the philistines against Jehovah. It’s a profound lesson for me on silencing negative thoughts, refocusing on Jehovah’s wavelength, then like David - being courageous and strong and going to work.
